Buddha, "The non-doing of any evil, the performance of what's skillful, the cleansing of one's own mind: this is the teaching of the Awakened. --Buddha"
Buddha, "Let none deceive another, Or despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or ill-will Wish harm upon another. Even as a mother protects with her life Her child, her only child, So with a boundless heart Should one cherish all living beings; Radiating kindness over the entire world: Spreading upwards to the skies, And downwards to the depths; Outwards and unbounded, Freed from hatred and ill-will. Whether standing or walking, seated or lying down Free from drowsiness, One should sustain this recollection. This is said to be the sublime abiding."
Laozi, "A strong military, a tool of misfortune All things detest it Therefore, those who possess the Tao avoid it Honorable gentlemen, while at home, value the left When deploying the military, value the right The military is a tool of misfortune Not the tool of honorable gentlemen When using it out of necessity Calm detachment should be above all Victorious but without glory Those who glorify Are delighting in the killing Those who delight in killing Cannot achieve their ambitions upon the world Auspicious events favor the left Inauspicious events favor the right The lieutenant general is positioned to the left The ma jor general is positioned to the right We say that they are treated as if in a funeral Those who have been killed Should be mourned with sadness Victory in war should be treated as a funeral"
Laozi, "Those who understand others are intelligent Those who understand themselves are enlightened Those who overcome others have strength Those who overcome themselves are powerful Those who know contentment are wealthy Those who proceed vigorously have willpower Those who do not lose their base endure Those who die but do not perish have longevity"
Sokrates, "I would have you know that, if you kill such a one as I am, you will injure yourselves more than you will injure me. Meletus and Anytus will not injure me: they cannot; for it is not in the nature of things that a bad man should injure a better than himself. I do not deny that he may, perhaps, kill him, or drive him into exile, or deprive him of civil rights; and he may imagine, and others may imagine, that he is doing him a great injury: but in that I do not agree with him; for the evil of doing as Anytus is doing—of unjustly taking away another man’s life—is greater far. And now, Athenians, I am not going to argue for my own sake, as you may think, but for yours, that you may not sin against the god, or lightly reject his boon by condemning me."
Sokrates, "Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle."
